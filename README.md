# NDH Challenges
This repository is meant to be containing most of the challenges I developed for the NuitDuHack events thorough the years.
You can really see a progression between the first challenges I developed and the latest ones.

## Enjoy it responsibly
These challenges were meant for the Nuit du Hack events. They basically are beerwares. 
I encourage you to share beers with me if you enjoy them :-).
