# NDH Challenges
This repository is meant to be containing most of the challenges I developed for the NuitDuHack events thorough the years.
You can really see a progression between the first challenges I wrote and the latest ones.

## Enjoy it responsibly
These challenges were meant for the Nuit du Hack events. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have questions on some of them.
If you enjoy them, know that more will come next year.

If you see me at an event, don't hesitate to say hi :-)
